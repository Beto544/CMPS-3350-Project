# Heavy_Artillery-3350
Project for Software Enginering CMPS - 3350

Overview:
This game will be an artillery type game where players take turns attacking each other
with different projectiles in order to destroy each other. The players can be local, so that two
people take turns playing against each other on one system, or the players can be computer
controlled via AI. This allows for both single player gameplay where the user can play against
the computer and multiplayer, where the user can play with a friend. The game is played on a 2D
map that is also destroyed by the players when attacking each other, the heart of the gameplay is
based on the players strategically aiming their projectiles according to the angle and power of the
projectile that is set by the player in order to eliminate all the players until they are the last one
standing.

Requirements:
● C++
● Frameworks (bigfoot, asteroid)
● OpenGL
● Physics and A.I System
● I/O devices

Features & Controls:
● 2D maps
● Turn-based
● Sound effects
● Projectile dropoff physics
● Destructible map
● 1 V 1 battles
● Money/Coin System
● Local Multiplayer
● Playable w/ mouse and/or keyboard

Goals:
Goals include trying to add different types of projectiles, some that may have specific
angle or power limitations, as well as possibly even a coin or money system that is accrued with
each match so that players playing several matches in a row can purchase better projectiles with
each winning match. The players should also move instead of being fixed to a specific spot on
the map. In a tanks style game, “gas” is given to each player with each turn and they are allowed
to move along the x-axis by using the gas so while the end game might not be tanks and gas, the
same idea will hold which is to have the players (tanks in this example) be able to move!
